# edit the /pages/contacts.html file and change/remove the captcha mechanism, too.
# If using mailtome.php, set these, too:
fromaddy: <the email address from which you're forwarding the user's form data>
toaddy: <your email address>

# set this:
spotifyurl: <some playlist, doesn't have to be spotify>
