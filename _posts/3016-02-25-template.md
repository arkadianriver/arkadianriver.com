<hr />

You can control many things about each post with a few entries in its front matter.
The entries provide layout controls and the ability to combine many posts in a series
with **BACK**{: .ui} and **NEXT**{: .ui} buttons.

If you use the `ruby compose.rb` command to initiate your post, many of these
front matter entries are provided for you. This part of the guide explains all
of the entries available in this theme.

## Required

### `categories`

If it's a post, the categories array is required with at least
the first element set to the permalink name of its parent page
(so that breadcrumbs work).

{% highlight yaml %}
categories: topics ...
{% endhighlight %}

The two top-level categories with provided index pages are `topics` and `works`.

If you want **BACK**{: .ui} and **NEXT**{: .ui} navigation within a subcategory:

{:.nobullet}
- Create a first post for the sub-category, but with a permalink.
  The category list can be space-delimited on one line or in a bulleted list.
  Note that the category names must exactly match the permalink.

  ```yaml
  categories: topics my-great-vacation
  permalink: /topics/my-great-vacation/
  ```

{:.nobullet}
- The site permalink would be:
  `/topics/my-great-vacation/index.html`

{:.nobullet}
- If your subcategory contains spaces, specify categories as an array

  ```yaml
  categories:
    - topics
    - my great vacation
  permalink: /topics/my great vacation/
  ```

{:.nobullet}
- For subsequent topics in the sub-category, add the sub-category and no
  permalink:

  ```yaml
  categories: topics my-great-vacation
  ```

{:.nobullet}
- That results in: `/topics/my-great-vacation/topic-title.html`

{:.nobullet}
- Topics in the sub-category are sorted by date and time. Therefore, if they
  all fall on the same day, specify the date in the post with a timestamp by
  which to sort.

  ```yaml
  date: 3009-09-22 00:00:03
  ```


### `excerpt`

You'll probably wanna provide an excerpt in front-matter, because relying on Jekyll
to get the excerpt from the body has too many caveats. The excerpt is truncated
as necessary in references, so it can be as long as you want, but because it's also
displayed in all caps right under the topic title, you'll definitely want to preview
how it looks.

{% highlight yaml %}
excerpt: yada yada
{% endhighlight %}

### `permalink`

If it's the first page of a sub-category, use a permalink for the categories.
It becomes the index that a breadcrumb link would pop up to, ie:
`/topics/new-category/index.html`. Also see `categories`.

{% highlight yaml %}
permalink: /topics/new-category/
{% endhighlight %}

### `title`

Title for `<title/>` and article `<h1/>`. For this and all other fields, refer to Yaml
restrictions on when you need to quote the value.

{% highlight yaml %}
title: My interesting topic
{% endhighlight %}


## Presentation options

### `author`

If you want the article to be attributed to an author, specify a name that
corresponds to a key in the `_data\authors.yml` file.

{% highlight yaml %}
author: key_name
{% endhighlight %}

### `background-image`

If you want a larger title block with a background image, specify it here.
If it's in the `/images/` folder, specify just the name;
otherwise specify the folder relative to your jekyll root, starting with `/`.
If it's a remote image, begin the name with `//`.
Use a high resolution image, if possible,
for when viewed full screen. Once displayed, you'll wanna slowly resize your
browser or use its developer tools to see how the image responds for all `@media`
breakpoints and crop it as necessary.

{% highlight yaml %}
background-image: imagefile.png
{% endhighlight %}

### `icon`

For the featured articles on the main page, if you want an icon other than
the heart icon, specify the `font-awesome` icon identifier (just the text after `fa-`).
See the [font-awesome icons]({{ '/topics/user-guide/icons.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
topic for a list of available icons.

{% highlight yaml %}
icon: industry
{% endhighlight %}

### `image`

For pages to be listed on the front landing page, you can provide an image to be used
in the listing. If you do not provide an image, the banner image will be used instead.

{% highlight yaml %}
image: imagefile.png
{% endhighlight %}

### `layout`

For both posts and pages, there's no need to specify the layout.
Specifying the layout is optional because defaults
are set in the `_config.yml` file to set the layout based on the folder it's in
(`_posts` or `_pages`). The layout _is_ useful for pages outside of these folders,
however.

{% highlight yaml %}
layout: {page|post}
{% endhighlight %}

### `options`

The options allow you to customize the page somewhat.

{% highlight yaml %}
options:
  - minihead      # as minimal a title as possible, and no date printed
  - fullwidth     # leaving only a tiny margin on all media sizes
  - nocomment     # disable disqus comments for this post
  - nomenu        # for pages, don't add to the menu
  - nolanding     # for pages and featured posts, don't add to the landing page
{% endhighlight %}

{% include post_note.html type="note" text="Disqus comments are not displayed on works posts." %}

## Ordering and site map options

### `changefreq`

The default change frequency for all pages in the site map is `monthly`.
Depending on how often you think you'll edit a page, you can set the page
change frequency. <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.v9seo.com/blog/2011/12/27/sitemap-xml-why-changefreq-priority-are-important/">Here's
a good guide</a> on when to use the available values.

{% highlight yaml %}
changefreq: weekly
{% endhighlight %}

### `key`

All files in the `_pages` folder are displayed in the nav menu unless you
set the `nomenu` option.
Use `key` to specify the order you want the pages listed in the nav menu.
Values are sorted in ascending order.

{% highlight yaml %}
key: 2
{% endhighlight %}

### `lastmod`, `date`

If you want the site map `lastmod` setting to be updated, you can set one or both of
these to your new modified date as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT` (`lastmod` has priority).
If you use `date`, the date shown on the page is also modified, overriding the
date in the filename. The timestamp is assumed to be UTC unless you specify the
time zone offset afterward.

{% highlight yaml %}
lastmod: 2016-03-13 23:11:00
date: 2016-01-01 00:00:00 -0800
{% endhighlight %}

### `priority`

Use `priority` to specify two things:

- the grouping in the works index
- the site map priority

{% highlight yaml %}
priority: 0.8
{% endhighlight %}

In the works index, the works are grouped by priority, listed by descending priority
and by descending date within each priority.

{% include post_note.html type="tip" text="For now, works posts must have a priority set for the ordering to work. If you get a &#8220;can't compare float with nil&#8221; error in your Jekyll build, there's a missing priority somewhere." %}

Because the value is used to set the site map priority,
it must be set to a value between 0 and 1.0.
I've personally chosen three groups of works, with priorities 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5.
None as high as featured posts, but then, I'm not looking for a job right now. ;-)

Default priorities in the `sitemap.xml` file:

- `1.0` - Landing page
- `0.9` - Featured posts
- `0.7` - Other posts
- `0.5` - Pages

### `sitemap_exclude`

Set to `yes` if you want to exclude a page from the sitemap.

{% highlight yaml %}
sitemap_exclude: yes
{% endhighlight %}

### `tags`

For _topics_ posts, the only tag that has an effect right now is `featured`,
which adds it to the top of the `/topics/` page. The eight most recent
featured posts are also added to the main landing page.

{% highlight yaml %}
tags: featured
{% endhighlight %}

For _works_ posts, the tags become a listing of skills demonstrated. For example:

{% highlight yaml %}
tags:
  - C
  - Windows DLL
  - SGML
{% endhighlight %}

![web page display of the preceding tags]({{ '/images/skills.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

You can add the `featured` tag to a work if you want it to appear on the main landing page.
The `featured` tag is excluded from the list of skills on the page and `works` index.
However, its page priority overrides the standard priority of featured posts in the site map.

## CSS and Script support

### `includes`

If your page needs to include stylesheets or scripts, provide 'em as either
local or remote URLs. Prefix remote urls with `//`, not `http`. Stylesheets
are included in the header and scripts at the bottom before the body closes.

{% highlight yaml %}
style-includes:
  - /local/path/to/stylesheet.css
  - //remote.com/url/to/stylesheet.css
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight yaml %}
script-includes:
  - /local/path/to/script.js
  - //remote.com/url/to/script.js
{% endhighlight %}

### `style, script`

These are useful when you want to embed styles and scripts outside of the
<code>{% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}</code> area.
Use the Yaml `|` indented block to ensure line breaks are preserved.
The styles are included in the header below stylesheet includes;
scripts are included at the bottom below script includes.

{% highlight yaml %}
style: |
  /* some css block here */
  .some-class {
    somestyle: definition;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight yaml %}
script: |
  // some script block here...
  $(document).ready(function(){
    ...
  });
{% endhighlight %}
