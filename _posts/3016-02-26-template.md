## Required

Title for `<title/>` and `<h1/>`. For this and all other fields refer to Yaml
restrictions on when you need to quote the value.

{% highlight yaml %}
title: My interesting topic
{% endhighlight %}

If page, put in pages folder, with no categories set and with a permalink that
its children should set e.g. if page has permalink: `/blog/`, its posts should
have categories: `[blog, ...]`.

{% highlight yaml %}
layout: [post | page]
{% endhighlight %}

The options allow you to customize the page somewhat.

{% highlight yaml %}
options:
  - minihead      # as minimal a title as possible, and no date printed
  - fullwidth     # leaving only a very tiny margin
  - nocomment     # disable disqus comments for this post
  - nomenu        # for pages, don't add to the menu
  - nolanding     # for pages and featured posts, don't add to the landing page
{% endhighlight %}

Recommended to provide an excerpt in front-matter because _in-body_ extraction
is unpredictable. Truncated as necessary in references, so it can be as long
as you want. But, also displayed, centered, right under the topic title (in
all caps in original style).

{% highlight yaml %}
excerpt: yada yada
{% endhighlight %}


## Optional

*IF* it's a blog post, categories array is required with at least the first
element set to the permalink name of its parent page (so that breadcrumbs
work). If there are more categories, then create a parent for that category
to act just as a page would, with a permalink and a loop through its kids
or pagination. Breadcrumb and site permalink is:
`/category1(e.g. topics)/category2/.../title.html`

{% highlight yaml %}
categories: topics, ...
{% endhighlight %}

*IF* parent page, use permalink for it's new category, but **do not** specify
that new category for this parent page itself, because it becomes the index,
ie: `/new-category/index.html`

{% highlight yaml %}
permalink: /new-category/
{% endhighlight %}

If you want a larger title block with a background image, put it in the images
folder and provide it here. The image should be over 4K so that it doesn't
blur much when viewed full screen HD.

{% highlight yaml %}
background-image: imagename.[png|jpg|...]
{% endhighlight %}

You can add tags. The only tag that has an effect right now is `featured`,
which changes its display in the `/topics/` page.

{% highlight yaml %}
tags: featured
{% endhighlight %}

If authored by someone other than site.owner, specify a name that
corresponds to a key in the `_data\authors.yml` file.

{% highlight yaml %}
author: key_name
{% endhighlight %}


## CSS and Script support

If your page needs to include stylesheets or scripts, provide 'em as either
local or remote URLs. Prefix remote urls with `//`, not `http`. Stylesheets
are included in the header, and scripts at the bottom before the body closes.

{% highlight yaml %}
style-includes:
  - /local/path/to/stylesheet.css
  - //remote.com/url/to/stylesheet.css
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight yaml %}
script-includes:
  - /local/path/to/script.js
  - //remote.com/url/to/script.js
{% endhighlight %}

You can embed styles and scripts, too. Use the yaml `|` indented block to
ensure line breaks are preserved. Styles output in header below stylesheet
includes, scripts at bottom underneath script includes.

{% highlight yaml %}
style: |
  /* some css block here */
  .some-class {
    somestyle: definition;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight yaml %}
script: |
  // some script block here...
  $(document).ready(function(){
    ...
  });
    somestyle: definition;
  }
{% endhighlight %}
